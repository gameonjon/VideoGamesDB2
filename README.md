# VideoGamesDB2
PURPOSE:
    The purpose of this project is to go above the minimun requirement of my previous Database Systems course project.

In the previous project, I only focused on the backend side, creating the entire schema; while my partner focused on the frontend and server-side. This time around I am focusing on all parts. The differences from the previous project and this one is adding more detail(constraints, defualts, ...) to the schema tables(using Python) and creating POST, PATCH and DELETE requests for the server(using Nodejs). 'index.html' and 'addData.html' is the website layout.

SETUP:
-Install Node.js, Download at: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 
-npm init
-npm install sqlite3
-npm install express
-npm install bluebird

After those installs, you can now run the project and test. These packages are required for using 'server.js'. To run, go to termal and input 'npm run start'.
